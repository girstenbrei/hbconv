For fun, I wanted to track my expenses. Per random, I landet on the software
[HomeBank](https://www.gethomebank.org/en/index.php).

I'm not affiliated with them nor is this a recommendation for any piece of
software.

I have an account with the Postbank and needed to import a Postbank CSV file
into homebank. As their formats wildly differ, this is a small tool to make
a Postbank CSV importable by HomeBank.
